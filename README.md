# Unique READme Generator

## Description
This project is an application designed to create and generate a unique READme with the user input collected by inquirer, using Nodejs. I was motivated to create this project due to the fact that I am constantly writing READmes for my Github projects and wanted to create a way to easily generate this document without forgetting any of the components of the document. This project allows the user to answer a simple list of questions prompted by the Nodejs inqirer, and formats the information correctly into a usable HTML document. While completing this project, I reinforced my knowledge of javascript while learning how to use Nodejs, inquirer, and general back-end development that is independent of an internet browser.

## Installation
You can access the repository to utilize the application at the following link: https://github.com/gwenparadis/unique-README-generator.

## Usage
Once you have accessed the code on Github,  you can clone the code into your own desired code editor. From there, you can open the index.js file in an integrated terminal to begin running the code. Send the command "node index.js" into the command line and hit enter. At this time, inquirer will begin asking the user the list of prompts. For each prompt except for the licenses, type the answer or complete the sentence provided. For the licenses, you will use the arrow keys to navigate through a drop-down menu and select the license you utilized for the project. When all prompts are done, you will see a success message in the command line. There will be a new "index.html" file in the folder, that can be access directly in it's coded format or viewed in the browser to see the completed product. I have included the example HTML file from my Screencastify video for grading purposes.
